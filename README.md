1) Export to this folder, overwrite the files
2) Change .php.html to .php and overwrite with it
3) Copy account and ashboard from BS to their php files manually**
4) Start XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL
5) Open localhost/eduplanet on a browser and it should work flawlessly

**(Create the pages in bootstrap studio and then export it.
Then copy the exported files into account.php and dashboard.php manually.
All that because I can't put their php code into BS.)

1) Export to this folder, overwrite the files
2) Change .php.html to .php and overwrite with it
3) Copy the account.php**
4) Start XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL
5) Open localhost/eduplanet on a browser and it should work flawlessly

**(Create the page for account in bootstrap studio and then export it.
Then copy the exported file into account.php manually.
All that because I can't put account.php's code into BS.)
